Dev Notes
---------

These notes are for developers to keep in mind since Old Toontown is just starting:

The phase files will not be included in the source code until we switch to the 2003 phase files since it would just be a waste of time having to push/commit etc, just put in the phase files yourself to work with until it's time to add the official 2003 phase files. It doesn't matter what phase files you use since it won't be official until the 2003 phase files are in.
